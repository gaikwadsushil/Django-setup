## üåü Setup Guide

### 1. Create a New Project Folder

- Create a new folder for your Django project (e.g., **"Django_Project"**).

### 2. Open Terminal
- Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code (Terminal > New Terminal).

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
- Type the following command to create a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv env
  ```

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment
- For Windows, type:
  ```bash
  env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- For macOS/Linux, type:
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

### 5. Install Django
- Type the following command to install Django:
  ```bash
  pip install Django
  ```

### 6. Check Installed Packages
- Run the command to see the installed packages:
  ```bash
  pip freeze
  ```

### 7. Start a New Django Project
- Type the following command to create a new Django project named **"qubits"**:
  ```bash
  django-admin startproject qubits
  ```

### 8. Rename the Project Folder
- Change directory into the project folder and rename it if desired (e.g., **"main_project"**).
  ```bash
  cd qubits
  ```
  (then rename as needed)

### 9. Run the Development Server
- Type the command to run the server:
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

### 10. Access Django Settings
- In VS Code, search for and open **`settings.py`** within your project folder.

### 11. Add URL Patterns
- Inside **`settings.py`**, add URL patterns to the `urlpatterns` list:
  ```python
  path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
  path('index/', views.index),
  path('sushi/', views.sushil),
  ```

### 12. Create Views
- In **`views.py`**, define views for your application:
  ```python
  def sushil(request):
      return render(request, 'sushil.html')
  ```

### 13. Create Templates
- Create a folder named **`templates`** inside your main project directory.
- Inside **`templates`**, create the HTML files (e.g., **`index.html`**, **`sushil.html`**) and write your HTML code.

### 14. Run the Server Again
- To see your changes, run the server again with:
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

### 15. Create a New App (Optional)
- If your project requires separate functionality, create a new app:
  ```bash
  python manage.py startapp sushi_app
  ```

### 16. Add the App to Installed Apps
- In **`settings.py`**, add your new app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:
  ```python
  'sushi_app',
  ```

### 17. Create Models
- Define models in **`sushi_app/models.py`** for your data structure.

### 18. Create and Apply Migrations for the Models
- Run the commands to create and apply migrations:
  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

### 19. Register Models in Admin
- In **`sushi_app/admin.py`**, register your models to make them accessible in the admin interface.

### 20. Create Superuser for Admin Access
- Create a superuser account to access the admin panel:
  ```bash
  python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

### 21. Access the Admin Interface
- Start the server and navigate to the admin interface at:
  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
  ```

### 22. Implement Forms and User Input (Optional)
- If needed, create forms in **`forms.py`** to handle user input.

### 23. Testing and Debugging
- Test your application thoroughly and fix any bugs.

### 24. Deployment (Advanced)
- Deploy your Django project to a production server (e.g., Heroku, DigitalOcean).

### 25. Documentation and Maintenance
- Maintain documentation for your project and keep it updated.
